# GEO Global Ecosystem Atlas
Code repository for the GEO Global Ecosystem Atlas

### Description
The GEO Global Ecosystem Atlas will bring together high-quality global, regional and national ecosystem maps into a single, open, online resource. Presenting the extent, structure and function of the world’s ecosystems in unprecedented detail, the Atlas will enable everyone—from governments to individual citizens—to take action to protect nature.

This repository contains the source software developed for the GEO Atlas project. A full description of the methods, validation, and limitations of the data produced by this software will be made available at a future date. For project updates and further information, please refer to the [GEO Global Ecosystem Atlas website](https://earthobservations.org/solutions/incubators/global-ecosystems-atlas).

### Code
This repository contains Python (for ESRI products) and Javascript (for Google Earth Engine) code for developing the major products being developed to bring together the world's spatial data on ecosystem extent and change.  Major aspects of the project include:

1. Database of existing ecosystem map products, hosting source metadata and licensing information.
2. Data repository of existing ecosystem map products, hosting spatial datasets of ecosystem distributions.
3. Data processing routines.
4. Routines for developing the baseline global ecosystem extent data product.
5. Online visualisation and access to GEO Atlas data products.
